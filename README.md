This website serves as my Portfolio for all of my projects at The Tech Academy, as well as my personal side-projects. The web page and contents within were created myself. 

The Portfolio can be easily opened in a desktop web browser: <strong><a href="https://crewscontrolsolutions.github.io/" target="new">Kyle Crews' Portfolio</a></strong>.

For questions or comments, please contact me via the Contact Form on my website above, or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylecrews94/" target="new">LinkedIn.</a> 

This README will be continuously updated as improvements to my Portfolio are made.
